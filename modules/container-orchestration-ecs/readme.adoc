==== Getting Started with Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate

Before we get started, here are some definitions you need to understand in order to deploy your application when creating your first Amazon ECS cluster.

[options="header"]
|=======================
| Object | Cluster
| *Cluster* | Logical grouping of tasks and services. Infrastructure may be shared between tasks and services running on the same cluster.
| *Task Definition* | Blueprint for our application. Defines attributes such as CPU and memory requirements, networking configuration, and container definitions.
| *Container Definition* | Configuration for a container to run as part of our task. Defines attributes of the container including port mappings, resources requirements, environment variables, etc.
| *Service* | Maintains a specified number of running simultaneous instances of a task definition in an ECS cluster.
|=======================

You'll deploy a service via Amazon ECS using AWS Fargate as the launch type. The Fargate launch type allows you to run your containerized applications without the need to provision and manage the back-end infrastructure. Amazon ECS can also launch tasks and services using the EC2 launch type which runs containerized applications on Amazon EC2 instances that *you* manage. Amazon ECS is the orchestration service responsible for running docker containers and AWS Fargate is the underlying compute platform where the containers will run.

===== Deploy our VPC

We will first deploy our CloudFormation template which configures our ECS VPC.

Step 1:: Change to this modules directory by running:
+
[source,shell]
----
cd ~/environment/aws-modernization-workshop-advanced/modules/container-orchestration-ecs
----
+
Step 2:: Deploy the CloudFormation template to create your new VPC
+
[source,shell]
----
aws cloudformation create-stack \
  --stack-name "petstore" \
  --template-body file://petstore-fargate-cf-resources.yaml \
  --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
----
+
Expected Output:
+
[.output]
....
{
    "StackId": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:<REDACTED>:stack/petstore/5ce363e0-773c-11e9-9589-02c3ece5f9fa"
}
....
+
Step 3:: Wait for the Template to finish deploying
+
[source,shell]
----
until [[ `aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name "petstore" --query "Stacks[0].[StackStatus]" --output text` == "CREATE_COMPLETE" ]]; do  echo "The stack is NOT in a state of CREATE_COMPLETE at `date`";   sleep 30; done && echo "The Stack is built at `date` - Please proceed"
----

===== Amazon ECS Task definitions

link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html[Amazon ECS Task definitions] are required to run Docker containers in Amazon ECS. For our pestore application, we will review the key pieces of a task definition before we deploy it.

Step 1:: Open the `petstore-fargate-task-definition.json` file.
+
The file has the following content:
+
[.output]
....
{
  "family": "petstore",
  "networkMode": "awsvpc",
  "containerDefinitions": [{
      "name": "postgres",
      "image": "<YourAccountID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/petstore_postgres:latest",
      "cpu": 512,
      "memoryReservation": 1024,
      "environment": [{
          "name": "POSTGRES_DB",
          "value": "petstore"
        },
        {
          "name": "POSTGRES_USER",
          "value": "admin"
        },
        {
          "name": "POSTGRES_PASSWORD",
          "value": "password"
        }
      ],
      "portMappings": [{
        "containerPort": 5432
      }],
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "petstore",
          "awslogs-region": "us-west-2",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "petstore/postgres"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "petstore",
      "image": "<YourAccountID>.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/petstore_frontend:latest",
      "cpu": 512,
      "memoryReservation": 1024,
      "environment": [
        {
          "name": "DB_HOST",
          "value": "127.0.0.1"
        },
        {
          "name": "DB_NAME",
          "value": "petstore"
        },
        {
          "name": "DB_PASS",
          "value": "password"
        },
        {
          "name": "DB_PORT",
          "value": "5432"
        },
        {
          "name": "DB_URL",
          "value": "jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/petstore?ApplicationName=applicationPetstore"
        },
        {
          "name": "DB_USER",
          "value": "admin"
        }
      ],
      "portMappings": [{
        "containerPort": 8080
      }],
      "logConfiguration": {
        "logDriver": "awslogs",
        "options": {
          "awslogs-group": "petstore",
          "awslogs-region": "us-west-2",
          "awslogs-stream-prefix": "petstore/frontend"
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::<YourAccountID>:role/petstoreExecutionRole",
  "requiresCompatibilities": [
    "FARGATE"
  ],
  "cpu": "1 vcpu",
  "memory": "2 gb"
}
....
+
Step 2:: We need to replace the placeholder for your account id in the template file, so that is aware of your account. The following commands will do that for you automatically using the `sed` and `aws` cli tools. These should be executed in the in the Cloud9 `terminal`.
+
[source,shell]
----
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws ecr describe-repositories --repository-name petstore_frontend --query=repositories[0].repositoryUri --output=text | cut -d"." -f1)

echo ${ACCOUNT_ID}

sed -i "s/<YourAccountID>/${ACCOUNT_ID}/" ~/environment/aws-modernization-workshop-advanced/modules/container-orchestration-ecs/petstore-fargate-task-definition.json
----
+
Step 3:: Create a new task definition from the JSON file by running this command:
+
[source,shell]
----
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://~/environment/aws-modernization-workshop-advanced/modules/container-orchestration-ecs/petstore-fargate-task-definition.json
----

===== Create the Petstore Service with Amazon ECS using Fargate

Step 1:: Go to the *AWS Management Console*, click *Services* then select *ECS* under the *Compute* heading.
+
image:ecs-service.png[Select ECS]
+
Step 2:: On the left hand navigation ensure *Clusters* is selected and click *Create Cluster*.
+
image:create-cluster.png[Create Cluster]
+
Step 3:: On the *Select cluster template* screen select *Networking only* which should have a *Powered by AWS Fargate* label and click *Next step*.
+
image:cluster-template.png[Cluster Template]
+
Step 4:: Enter a Cluster name of *petstore-workshop* and leave the Create VPC box *unchecked* and click *Create*.
+
image:configure-ecs-cluster.png[Configure Cluster]
+
Step 5:: Once your cluster is created, view your cluster and the *Services* tab should be selected. Click *Create*.
+
image:create-fargate.png[View Cluster]
+
Step 6:: Select a *Launch type* of *FARGATE*
+
Step 7:: Select *petstore* and the latest *revision* for the *Task Definition*.
+
Step 8:: Enter *petstore* for the *Service name*.
+
Step 9:: Enter *1* into *Number of tasks* and click *Next step*.
+
image:configure-fargate-service.png[Configure Service]
+
Step 10:: Select the *petstore* VPC for *Cluster VPC*.
+
[TIP]
====
To find the *petstore* VPC, mouse over the VPC's listed to find the one that ends with `petstore` *_OR_* run the following command in the Cloud9 `terminal`:

[source,shell]
----
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name "petstore" --query "Stacks[0].Outputs[?OutputKey=='VPC'].OutputValue"
----
====
+
Step 11:: Select the two *Public* petstore Subnets for *Subnets*.
+
Step 12:: For *Security Groups* click *Edit* then click *Select an existing Security Group*. Select the *default* Security Group and click *Save*. You will notice that the default Security Group only allows port `8080` from `PetStoreLbSecurityGroup` to secure our petstore application.
+
image:ecs-sg.png[Security Group]
+
Step 13:: Select *ENABLED* from *Auto-assign public IP*. This allows your tasks to retrieve the Docker image from Amazon ECR and stream logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. The image below shows an example of these settings:
+
image:ecs-configure-network.png[ECS Network]
+
Step 14:: Set the *Health check grace period* to *300*.
+
NOTE: This is the period of time, in seconds, that the Amazon ECS service scheduler should ignore unhealthy Elastic Load Balancing target health checks after a task has first started. This is only valid if your service is configured to use a load balancer. If your service's tasks take a while to start and respond to health checks, you can specify a health check grace period of up to `7,200` seconds during which the ECS service scheduler ignores the health check status. This grace period can prevent the ECS service scheduler from marking tasks as unhealthy and stopping them before they have time to come up.
+
Step 15:: Under the *Load Balancing* section, select *Application Load Balancer* and make sure *petstore-lb* is selected, as shows below:
+
image:petstore-lb.png[Petstore-LB]
+
Step 16:: For *Container to load balance* select *petstore:8080:8080* and click *Add to load balancer*.
+
image:add-to-lb.png[Container to LB]
+
Step 17:: Type in `80` for the *Listener port* and ensure it is set to *create new*.
+
Step 18:: Ensure that *Target group name* is set to *create new* and the name should be *ecs-petsto-petstore*.
+
image:petstore-8080.png[Container to LB]
+
Step 19:: Under *Service Discovery (optional)*, *Uncheck* the box for *Enable service discovery integration* and click *Next step*.
+
image:enable-sdi.png[Enable Service Discovery]
+
Step 20:: The next page allows you to define an *Auto Scaling policy*. Leave this set to *Do not adjust the service's desired count* for now and click *Next step*.
+
image:ecs-as-disable.png[Disable Autoscaling]
+
Step 21:: Review your settings and click *Create Service*.
+
Step 22:: The service will now start your task. Click *View Service* and you will have to wait for your task to transition to *RUNNING*. Feel free to inspect the logs for your task while you wait.
+
Step 23:: Once the task is running, view the *Details* of the petstore *Service*. Under *Load Balancing* click the *ecs-petsto-petstore* Target Group link to view the Tasks being registered into the Target Group under *Targets*.
+
image:ecs-view-target.png[View Target Group]
+
Step 24:: Once your Registered Target is registered as *Healthy* you can view the service through the Application Load Balancer.
+
image:ecs-target-healthy.png[Healthy Target]
+
Step 25:: Get the URL for your running application by running the following command in the Cloud9 `terminal`:
+
[source,shell]
----
printf "http://%s\n" $(aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers --names="petstore-lb" --query="LoadBalancers[0].DNSName" --output=text)
----
+
Step 26:: Open the URL output above in your Browser.

Now that we have a Fargate cluster, with a Service using our application, deployed we can move onto the next module of the workshop to duplicate this process using link:https://aws.amazon.com/eks/[Amazon EKS] as our orchestrator.
